# filetools 
--------------------------------
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/HaoKunT/filetools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HaoKunT/filetools)

some tools of file

## Why
For practice and replace so many different tools, the `filetools` will combine more features about file into one command.

## Build
`build-release.sh` is a shell script to build the release, it can be all different architectures and platforms binary files
``` bash
./build-release.sh
```
The release file will be build in `release` directory

## Usage
``` bash
./filetools -h
```

## Now command
- `compare`: Compare the different between two directories, it also can comapre the files
- `copy`: Copy the files or directories to other path, it has progressBar
- `info`: Output the information about a file or directory
- `rename`: Rename a file, it can keep the original file
- `list`: List files in a directory, it can sort files, limit the number of files, so it's useful to find the large files in a directory. if you find your disk space is not enough, you can findout which files are large and determine wether it can be deleted.
- `delete`: Delete a file or directory, this command is soft delete by default, it means we will move the file to the ~/.ft-trash directory, if you accidentally delete a file, you can recover it from the trash. We don't move the file into the cycle on Windows because it need use cgo, but I don't want it. You also can delete it directly, pass `-hd` to hard delete it. In future, we will use a flag to clean the trash.
- `move`: Move a file or directory, it may work like `mv`, but we are not satisfied with it, you should use it be careful. Of course, the normal condition is ok, I means there are some extremely case not been tested, if you find any bugs on it, please tell me.

## i18n
filetools support gettext by use `github.com/chai2010/gettext-go`, the local file is `local.zip`, use `github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata` to embed the local file into binary file, the file `local_pack.go` is generated by `go-bindata`, please don't edit it.

if you want to make your local file, please follow the steps below
1. Edit the local file, like `local/zh_CN/LC_MESSAGES/filetools.po`
2. Use command `msg -o local/zh_CN/LC_MESSAGES/filetools.mo local/zh_CN/LC_MESSAGES/filetools.po` to build MO file
3. zip the `local` directory into `local.zip`
4. Use command `go-bindata -o=local_pack.go -pkg=main local.zip` to generate the support go file.(You need to install go-bindata before)
5. Build the binary file

## todo
More command and flag will be add in the future
